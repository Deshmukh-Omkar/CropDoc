# CropDoc
CropDoc is a Web Application which predicts crop diseases from user sourced input, across 18 crops and 55 diseases using a Keras Sequential Deep Learning model.
## Problem Statement
Since the birth of farming, a major challenge has always been to safekeep the crops from diseases and pests. However, nature always plays the upper hand and farmers have learnt from trial and error, passing down their learnings to future generations. Evolution of science allowed us to study these diseases in depth and provide fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides etc. to help get the maximum yield.

However, a challenge prevails at the farmer's end. In developing country, such as India, farmers lack the preliminary knowledge of diseases their crops suffer with. That's where CropDoc steps in to empower them. CropDoc allows them to gain insight on an unknown disease by just clicking an image and uploading it to the website. The AI detects the disease and provides back with relevant details along with links for further information.
